# Your harness

## Depth over simplicity

Assignment 1 came back marked too simple, too linear, and not interactive
enough. That was a directing failure, not a scope failure: I let the agent
reach for whichever version was easiest to implement instead of holding out
for the version that was actually interesting. Rules to stop that happening
again:

- Never simplify an idea just because the simpler version is easier to build.
  A focused idea still needs enough depth, variation and room to explore ---
  "focused" means the central idea stays clear, not that everything around it
  gets stripped away.
- This is HCI and interactive design work. Don't default to static
  information pages, plain forms, or basic input-in/output-out interactions.
  The interaction itself should let someone explore, experiment, get feedback
  and come to understand the idea by using it, not by reading about it.
- Visual presentation and playfulness are part of the quality of the
  response, not decoration to bolt on if time allows. Treat them as
  load-bearing from the start of the build, not a pass at the end.
- When exploring a direction, start from something richer than feels
  comfortable and refine it down, rather than starting minimal and hoping to
  add richness back in later --- that's how last time ended up linear.

## Verify agent work before trusting it

A "done" report is a claim, not evidence. Passing checks are necessary but
not sufficient either --- a check only tests what it was written to test,
and something can pass every automated check while still being visibly wrong
in the actual rendered result.

- Read the real diff and rerun the checks yourself before calling any
  delegated or background work complete --- don't take a summary report on
  faith, even when it looks accurate.
- Look at the actual rendered artefact (the page, the screen, the output),
  not just green checks. A broken result can still pass every check that
  exists; only looking at the thing catches what the checks don't measure.

## Ground a redesign in the real reference system

When a project consolidates or redesigns an existing system, inspect the
real reference interface itself --- actual screenshots, rendered pages, or
primary documentation showing what it looks like and how it organises
information --- before restructuring the UI. Don't infer the product from
its branding, from a text description of what it does, or from generic
design patterns for "that kind of app": those get the vibe right and the
actual structure wrong.
